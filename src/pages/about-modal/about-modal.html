'HomeBiz365' is an e-commerce platform designed, developed, managed and owned by Clairvoyant BizInfo Pvt. Ltd., a company engaged into various activities through its diverse functional verticals. The company has launched its first e-commerce platform <a herf="www.homebiz365.in" >www.homebiz365.in</a> for its users that brings together home based entrepreneurs and the customers who love to buy quality home-made products.<br><br>

This platform is specially developed keeping in mind the home businesses which operate on small scale focusing on their quality, wish to expand their reach but face challenges of investment of money as well as time for marketing etc.<br><br>

Through this platform, now small product vendors can<br>
1. Have their presence on internet at very low cost<br>
2. Cross their boundaries and reach larger audience<br>
3. Showcase their products without extra cost<br>
4. Avail benefits of Digital Marketing at nominal cost<br>
5. Easily operate and use the platform as no need to be a tech-savvy person<br><br>

This platform works as a Lead Generation platform for home based small businesses owners. At the same time for customers at large, this acts as a place where they can have quality goods from vendors which are not operating on mass scale but are focusing on quality. So it’s a WIN ‐ WIN for both, vendors and customers.<br>
